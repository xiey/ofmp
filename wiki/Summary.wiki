The Open Financial Market Platform (OFMP) project's goal is to build an extensible, component-based Financial Market Platform based on industry business requirements and state of the art technologies.

It addresses several Financial Markets industry needs:

    * Improved interoperability and integration between Business Lines and Front to Back operations.
    * Financial Market Products flexibility.
    * Real-time view on Financial Markets Department's activity.

The frameworks, components and tools created by this project will be used by vendors, integrators and financial institutions to build tailor-made financial market applications. The components will leverage existing open source financial tools and libraries.
